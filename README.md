## Prerequisites

- Name of the existing VNET and subnet you want to connect the new virtual machine to.
- Name of the Resource Group that the VNET resides in.
- Depending on region deployed you might need to adjust template for vm SKU size supported. 


This template allows deploying two Ubuntu/NGINX VMs using an existing resource for the Virtual Network and subnet. It also allows for choosing between SSH and Password authenticate. 

The deployment will configure NGINIX, but this can also be done manually if desired. The steps below outline the manual deployment process.

- Identify the SSH ports of the VMSS by looking at the NAT rules on the DNSProxyloadBalancer
- ssh to the desired back-end VMSS instance
- > ssh -p (port ID from above) {username}@{loadbalancer-ip-address} to each NGINX VM to update its NGINX.conf
- Edit your NGINX.conf, and update x.x.x.x with the local private IP of each VMSS instance:
- > sudo nano /etc/nginx/nginx.conf

add the following module:

    stream {
          upstream dns_servers {
           server 168.63.129.16:53;
    }
    
    server {
     listen x.x.x.x:53  udp;
     listen x.x.x.x:53; #tcp
     proxy_pass dns_servers;
     proxy_responses 1;
     error_log  /var/log/nginx/dns.log info;
    }
    }

    

- sudo service nginx restart
